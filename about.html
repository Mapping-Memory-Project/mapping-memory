                <p style="color: rgb(39, 34, 38);"><br>On May 2, 2022, a draft of the Supreme Court majority decision to overturn Roe v Wade was leaked to the press. After nearly 50 years, the landmark Supreme Court ruling from 1973 that determined state-level abortion bans to be unconstitutional, appeared to be on the brink of being overturned. This kicked off a flurry of demonstrations, rallies, and protests across the United States- some in dissent and some in celebration. Then on June 24, 2022, the Supreme Court officially overturned the Roe v Wade ruling, making state abortion bans legal. The ruling sparked another wave of demonstrations on both sides. 
                    Michigan was no exception. In the state of Michigan, there was a 1931 law still on the books banning abortions except to ‘preserve the life of the mother.’ The penalty for breaking the law was up to four years in prison. An injunction was issued preventing the law from immediately going into effect after the Supreme Court ruling in June, and then on September 7th a Michigan judge ruled the 1931 to be unconstitutional. Pro-choice activists, concerned that this would be insufficient protection, moved to get a proposal on the mid-term election ballot that would amend the state constitution to legally protect abortion rights. The proposal ultimately passed and as of December 2022, the amendment will be in effect across the state. 
                    Between the time of the May leak and the June ruling there were 19 protests or rallies held across the state, two of these were pro-life and 17 were pro-choice. From the Supreme court ruling to September 7th, there were 40 of these events held state-wide- 11 pro-life and 39 pro-choice. Then from The September 7th decision to the November midterm elections, there were another 13 demonstrations, 9 pro-life and 4 pro-choice. This means that from the time of the leaked Supreme Court Ruling to the Midterm elections there were more than 50 demonstrations, rallies, or protests related to abortion rights held across the state.
